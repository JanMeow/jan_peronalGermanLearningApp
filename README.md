# jan_peronalGermanLearningApp
This is a simple App i built that connects a database of german words I learn everyday and connect it to a language model to generate a small diary using those 3 words of the day and at the end sending it to a image generation model to create a picture of the day.
All for fun !
Use your own own OpenAi token tho haha
